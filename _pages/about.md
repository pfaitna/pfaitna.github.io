I am a former hospital pharmacist turned research assistant at the [Dr Foster Unit](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dr-foster-unit) within Imperial College London. I use advanced statistical methodologies to analyse large health datasets to understand population health trends. I am especially interested in mental health and inequalities.

I am supervised by [Professor Alex Bottle](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=lEdZsS0AAAAJ&hl=en) and collaborate closely with [Professor Paul Aylin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dzEeCsMAAAAJ). 

Currently, I'm working on a [NIHR funded project](https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR202322) exploring the impact COVID-19 had on hospitals for children and young people's health and healthcare, collaborating closely with [Dr Dougal Hargreaves](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=zfA6dPQAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I have a MSc in Population Health from University College London and my dissertation was supervised by [Professor Anne McMunn](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=anne+mcmunn&btnG=) and [Dr Peter Martin](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qJtVYoIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I have a BSc in Pharmacy from Monash University, Australia.
